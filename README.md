# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!  
Here are my main works in **Game Development, Artificial Intelligence, Web Projects, Microservices, and Course Projects**.  
**Game video and AI projects are put in the front** so they are easy to see.

---

## Game Project
- Game-video  
  Repo: https://github.com/QiuQiuMuze/Game-video  
  This repo has one 2D game demo video (`game_video_1.mp4`).  
  It shows character move, fighting action, and level scene.  
  The video also shows how I make **scene loading, animation control, and event trigger** in Unity or self engine.  
  It is a short video, but it can show my ability in game design and making.

## AI Project
- EvoCore-AI  
  Repo: https://github.com/QiuQiuMuze/EvoCore-AI  
  This is my own AI framework. It is inspired by “cell system + neural network”.  
  Main parts:  
  - **Cell structure**: Sensor, Processor, Emitter, with energy and cell change.  
  - **Evolution**: Cells can connect, split, and merge like an ecosystem.  
  - **Reinforcement learning**: Use Transformer and Actor-Critic, support explore and reward shaping.  
  - **Cyber security test**: Extend to ImmuneCogGraph, it can fight virus/hacker attack, make “antibody” and memory.  

  This project mixes **deep learning, algorithm, and system simulation**.  
  The goal is to build an agent that can grow, learn, and adapt to the environment step by step.
